# Welcome to Foundational Project 2025
EIG's Foundational Project is back for 2025 with a bang! Dive into a 3-week hands-on journey where you'll learn:

1. 3D Modelling in Fusion 360 (17 July)
2. ESP32 Programming (24 July)
3. Wireless Connectivity & Assembly (31 July)

With no prior experience needed, you too are able to build a laser pointer/game controller of your own with components we provide!
It's a valuable hands-on experience that can enrich your portfolio!

📍 Venue: ESC #08-03-02
🕠 Time: 4:30PM–7:00PM on 17, 24 and 31 July
🎯 Open to all SOE students & EIG members

## Pre-Installation
1. [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
 - This is needed so that you can easily upload code onto your ESP32.  
2. [ESP32-BLE-Combo](https://github.com/ethanetexplorer/ESP32-BLE-Combo)
   a. Download the folders as a zip file
   b. In Arduino IDE, go to the top menu bar, and add the library by Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP library

   - This library contains all the keyboard and mouse related functions that you will need for this workshop./

**Most importantly**, you need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system!
- For Windows, please choose the (Windows 10 or newer, 64 bits) version.

## Examples
Examples and sample code can be found in this repository. Well - that's if I remember to update this with more examples lol (ethan), else it's just one single file.
